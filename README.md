# Claud Coin ($CLAUD)
[claud-coin](https://github.com/seanivore/claud-coin)

A Solana-based incentivization protocol for AI developer communities, focusing on Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration and knowledge sharing.

## 🎯 Mission

Claud Coin bridges the gap between traditional developers and the emerging "AI-native" development community by:
- Incentivize knowledge sharing and tool creation
- Rewarding quality contributions to the AI development ecosystem
- Creating a sustainable economy around AI tool development
- Gamifying the learning process for new AI developers

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project implements a three-tiered reward system:
1. Tool Usage [100-base-tokens]
   - Rewards for using and testing AI development tools
   - Complexity-based scoring system
   - Anti-gaming protections built-in

1. Resource Access [50-base-tokens]
   - Incentives for sharing development resources
   - Documentation contributions
   - Code examples and templates

2. Community Building [200-base-tokens]
   - Higher rewards for community contributions
   - Knowledge sharing and mentoring
   - Creating educational content

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Features
- Solana program for token management and distribution
- Achievement system with NFT integration [Phase-3]
- MCP integration for tool usage tracking
- Complexity scoring algorithm for fair rewards
- Anti-spam protections with cooldown periods

Hello, friend. 

We are ready to research for our $CLAUD MCP project. There are a handful of documents in Project Knowledge. From the official MCP.io documentation we have (1) a guide specifically for Claude building MCPs. The first step is what we're doing: Preparing documentation we'll need based on (2) the details of the project. 

1. 'building-mcp-with-llms.txt'
2. 'FUNCTIONAL-STRATEGY.md' 
3. 'RESEARCH-PLAN.md'

As we identify important documentation using our (3) research plan as a guide, we should build out our 'FEATURE_PLAN.md' document here: /Users/seanivore/Development/claud-coin/docs/FEATURE_PLAN.md

This document is where we will be doing all of our development planning. We much work out all issues ahead of time so that we can break the project up into small pieces to provide to the Aider Architect to build accordingly. The Aider Architect and Editor pair will build exactly as we specify. 

4. 'llms-full.txt' 
5. Python SDK 'README.md' 
6. Typescript SDK 'README.md' 

You'll note that in preparing documentation, the guide for Claude mentions using (4) "llms-full.txt" as well as (5, 6) the README.md files from the Python SDK repository, Typescript SDK repository (both of which we have copied in full). 

It says to include 'other relevant documentation' which is where we'll need to dig into the list (3) of other Official MCP.io and official Solana Development documentation in the form of copied repositories with examples and instructions. 

We will push through these folder-structures very thoroughly, deleting what we don't need, and keeping what we do as we go. 

When through these materials we should only have documentation left that we wanted to keep. We may need to explore other locations for more documentation or find recent MCP servers created in the community to complete our necessary documentation. 

So let's take this one step at a time, keeping records of our progress in a FEATURE_PLAN.md file so that we can easily pick off where we left off when we are rate limited and start a new thread. 

Give that all a good Sequential Think and I'll be here when you're ready to lead the way through this portion of the project.

# Token Economics & Distribution

## Token System Implementation
1. Token Mechanics
   - Distribution rules
   - Reward calculations
   - Transaction handling
   - Supply management

2. Reward Systems
   - MCP usage rewards
     * Tool usage tracking
     * Resource access points
     * Community contributions
   - Achievement rewards
     * Usage milestones
     * Community participation
     * Quality contributions
   - Special events
     * Launch bonuses
     * Community challenges
     * Testing rewards

3. Distribution Management
   - Initial distribution
   - Ongoing rewards
   - Supply controls
   - Transaction limits

### Implementation Notes

#### Reference Documentation

ABOUT THE PROJECT
/Users/seanivore/Development/claud-coin/docs/functional-strategy.md

1. Core MCP Evolution 

    A. Transport Mechanisms
    - stdio implementation details
    - SSE capabilities/requirements
    - Client/server combination examples
    - Real-time data flow patterns
    - Cross-MCP communication standards

    B. Recent Developments
    - New client/server architecture
    - Integration patterns
    - Authentication updates

2. Technical Implementation Examples 

    A. Official Repos
    - Python SDK examples
    - TypeScript SDK examples
    - FastMCP implementations
    - Modern client patterns

    B. Community Projects
    - Solana integration examples
    - Token system implementations
    - Real-time tracking methods

3. Documentation Sources 

    A. Primary Sources
    - modelcontextprotocol.io
    - Official SDK READMEs
    - Example repositories
    - llms-full.txt - /Users/seanivore/Development/claud-coin/docs/llms-full.txt 
    
    > How other projects are combining clients/servers
    > Standards for cross-MCP communication

    B. Implementation Guides
    - Building MCP with LLMs - https://modelcontextprotocol.io/tutorials/building-mcp-with-llms 
    - Client/Server best practices
    - SSE integration patterns 

    > Need to understand Rust/Solana requirements
    > How to properly bridge with MCP

Two MCP build repositories, of MCPs we use, that we happen to have copied. 
[/Users/seanivore/Development/terminal]
[/Users/seanivore/Development/mcp-notion-server]

A new, more complicated MCP that I just got a reddit notification for 'Systemprompt MCP Gmail Server'.

Might be interesting/helpful in the future: On-chain Game Development (and more).

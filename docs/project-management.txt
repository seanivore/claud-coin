---Current Development Phase - updated [1/22] of 2025 ---

Project: Production of $CLAUD token. 
/Users/seanivore/Development/claud-coin

1. Clean up 'FEATURE_PLAN.md' document
/Users/seanivore/Development/claud-coin/docs/FEATURE_PLAN.md

2. Pull details from 'planning-conversation-thread-cutoff.txt' to the document then delete that file. 
/Users/seanivore/Development/claud-coin/docs/planning-conversation-thread-cutoff.txt

3. Clean up 'aider-docs.txt' redundancy and remove install information 
/Users/seanivore/Development/claud-coin/docs/aider-docs.txt

4. Pull what is needed to the plan markdown then put actual document back in ~/Development/ for other project use

5. Find resource documents needed. Answer things like: 
- What approach are we taking
- Any important code snippets to save
- Save which URLs for aider to scrape if needed

I probably have so many more questions, but after, what chain will it be on ?! What chain did $TRUMP and $MELANIA use? Like what is the norm.? (Grifter PresidentÃ© Oye) 

6. When ready Start CONVENTIONS.md 

7. Website Consideration 
- The 'GitHub Project Pages' allows a website for every repo project
- Should we integrate that setup as well for task variety? 

FYI -- we have a repo, git init is done, both branches are claud-coin but just 'git push' is set up to work ðŸ˜Ž (<-- why does that work in this plain text document lol). And the files 'aider.conf.yml' and 'claud-coin.code-workspace' are added to .gitignore â€”Â I've learned woo!

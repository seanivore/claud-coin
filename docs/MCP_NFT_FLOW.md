# $CLAUD MCP Registration Flow 
PRIORITY: We must plan it out to the finest detail so that we can then create an automated process. 

1. User submits their Model Context Protocol (MCP) to the $CLAUD protocol for [VALIDATION](#validation) 
2. User included all necessary [MCP Registration Information](#mcp-registration-information)
3. $CLAUD validates the MCP testing it against the protocol's MCP validation criteria 
4. The MCP passes validation and is [Minted as an NFT](#minted-as-an-nft) on $CLAUD Protocol's network, Solana
5. Minting provides $CLAUD with a unique hash ID that [Links MCP to User's Account](#links-mcp-to-user-s-account)
6. The [MCP ID is Tracked Internally](#tracked-internally) is added to the internal knowledge graph and traditional database

## Validation
- Identify what validation testing will be needed 
- Great example of one site who is doing things pretty legit: https://smithery.ai 
- I think he puts them on his server and then pulls them into his own database 
- I wonder what his testing process is? 

## MCP Registration Information
- Identify what information is needed to register an MCP 

## Minted as an NFT
- Identify what the process is for minting an NFT on the $CLAUD Protocol's network, Solana
- Are smart contracts involved 

## Links MCP to User's Account
- Identify what the process is for linking an MCP to a user's account
- What data needs to be stored in the database to make this work? 
- How does the user get their MCP NFT? 
- Significantly, the complex token tracking must be figured out 
  - Sure, the MCP NFT would be visible in the user's wallet, but unless we are making our own wallet, it will provide no other information 
  - How do we add the tool into our MCP so that it can track usage? AH here we can be simple in that our MCP will need access to our database so that when it is installed, any time a tool is used by a user who has our MCP installed, it can track that usage. 
  - Maybe it doesn't actually need database access unless we are giving users more tokens for using registered tools versus unregistered tools -- which it seems like we probably should 
  - When we validate an MCP I think we will need to host it much like the smither.ai site to be able to add some kind of ID that our MCP will recognize if it is installed on the same client — ACTUALLY he does have a "can we track you usage" question when you install a tool using his site information which is, admittedly, a really easy process. He also is the only person I know of that provides Cursor command line setup for MCP tools. 
  - Still, we need a way for tokens awarded to the creator for other people using their tools to be first tracked for a counter on the tool, and then submitted into the users wallet -- some of this goes down below to the next section 

## Tracked Internally
- Added to an internal knowledge graph for ease of data visualization and analysis
- Added to a traditional database for ease of data retrieval, connection to external systems

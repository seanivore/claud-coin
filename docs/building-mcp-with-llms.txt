Building MCP with LLMs
Speed up your MCP development using LLMs such as Claude!

This guide will help you use LLMs to help you build custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients. We’ll be focusing on Claude for this tutorial, but you can do this with any frontier LLM.

Preparing the documentation
Before starting, gather the necessary documentation to help Claude understand MCP:

Visit https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt and copy the full documentation text
Navigate to either the MCP TypeScript SDK or Python SDK repository
Copy the README files and other relevant documentation
Paste these documents into your conversation with Claude
​
Describing your server
Once you’ve provided the documentation, clearly describe to Claude what kind of server you want to build. Be specific about:

What resources your server will expose
What tools it will provide
Any prompts it should offer
What external systems it needs to interact with
For example:

Build an MCP server that:
- Connects to my company's PostgreSQL database
- Exposes table schemas as resources
- Provides tools for running read-only SQL queries
- Includes prompts for common data analysis tasks
​
Working with Claude
When working with Claude on MCP servers:

Start with the core functionality first, then iterate to add more features
Ask Claude to explain any parts of the code you don’t understand
Request modifications or improvements as needed
Have Claude help you test the server and handle edge cases
Claude can help implement all the key MCP features:

Resource management and exposure
Tool definitions and implementations
Prompt templates and handlers
Error handling and logging
Connection and transport setup
​
Best practices
When building MCP servers with Claude:

Break down complex servers into smaller pieces
Test each component thoroughly before moving on
Keep security in mind - validate inputs and limit access appropriately
Document your code well for future maintenance
Follow MCP protocol specifications carefully
​
Next steps
After Claude helps you build your server:

Review the generated code carefully
Test the server with the MCP Inspector tool
Connect it to Claude.app or other MCP clients
Iterate based on real usage and feedback
Remember that Claude can help you modify and improve your server as requirements change over time.

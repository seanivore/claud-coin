# $CLAUD Feature Implementation Plan

## Core Token System
1. Set up base token contract
   - Token metadata
   - Basic minting functions
   - Storage structure

2. Sequential Thinking Integration
   - Add reward property to MCP output
   - Implement base reward calculation
   - Set up thought tracking

3. MCP Mining Integration
   - Create MCP validation system
   - Add verification process
   - Set up mining rewards

4. Token Distribution & Gifting
   - MCP wallet system
   - Gifting mechanics
   - Token flow tracking

## Implementation Order
Each feature will be broken down into micro-SPEC prompts (~200-600 tokens each):

### Phase 1: Basic Token Setup
1.1 Project structure & dependencies
1.2 Token contract boilerplate
1.3 Basic minting function
1.4 Storage structure 

### Phase 2: Sequential Thinking Rewards
2.1 Add reward property to MCP
2.2 Implement reward calculation
2.3 Link to token minting
2.4 Add thought chain tracking

### Phase 3: MCP Integration
3.1 Add validation properties
3.2 Create verification flow
3.3 Set up mining rewards
3.4 MCP wallet structure

### Phase 4: Gifting & Distribution
4.1 Basic wallet functions
4.2 Gifting mechanics
4.3 Flow tracking
4.4 Token history

Guide, Best Practices, Etc. (Needs to be cleaned up)
/Users/seanivore/Development/claud-coin/docs/aider-docs.txt

1. Dependencies and Key Documents:
- We should create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) file to define our token interactions
- We need a core token contract file
- We should establish conventions first (like you mentioned CONVENTIONS.md)

2. Folder Structure:
- Structur is set up. 

3. Project Inspo. Potential Guidelines to Pull

4. Also the mess of a thread from brainstorming then getting cut off

# Project Conception, Planning, Start of Overview 
This is a fascinating intersection of ideas! You're essentially proposing combining:
- Token-based reputation/curation for MCPs:
   - Usage metrics become meaningful because there's skin in the game
   - Gifting $CLAUD creates a more nuanced signal than just usage counts
   - MCPs could even have their own "wallets" showing community support
- Using this project to learn SPEC-style development:
   - Perfect test case since it involves both system architecture and AI interaction
   - We'd need to coordinate between different AI capabilities (like your Claude/DeepSeek example)
   - The complexity is just right - not trivial but not overwhelming

# Break down SPEC prmopts by token size. Start small with: ~275 tokens (simple UI updates like button styles)

[Example] 

Title: Add Token Reward Property to Sequential Thinking Output

Context:
/tools/sequentialthinking.js

Implementation Notes:
- Maintain existing thought output structure
- Add new tokenReward property
- Must integrate with current MCP framework

Low-Level Tasks:
1. Update sequentialthinking tool parameters to add:
   - tokenReward: integer
   - Track within thoughtNumber param set

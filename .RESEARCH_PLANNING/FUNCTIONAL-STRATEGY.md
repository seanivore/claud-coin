1. Mobile - should have a mobile first design 
[/Users/seanivore/Development/claud-coin/docs/platform-mock-up]
2. All AI dev users - craft strategy so that we're not boxed in to only Anthropic users

# Functioning of $CLAUD Coin 
>> The $CLAUD Model Context Protocol 
>> Our Website's leaderboards 
>> User Interactions 
>> User Behavior

## Concept & Strategy Breakdown 
1. Primary funcationality and user tracking comes from integration with a Model Context Protocol (MCP) 
2. "Proof of Analysis" 'mining' happens through collective particpatory ways 
3. Social connections encouraged similarly, as well as MCP curration, QA testing 
4. Beyond 'Cross-Claude-version compatibility' - any entity with our MCP can earn that way
5. Technically, anyone can 'play' by simply having a wallet and somehow aquiring #CLAUD cash 
6. Our target market and branding however is focused on creating community for new-to-coding AI Developers 

## Logitalical Planning 
1. Identify what eactly needs to be developed so that you can 
2. Identify and collect all relevant development documentation 
3. Leverage JavaScript blockchain tutorials as AI context 
4. Outline entire design process 
5. Break process outline into bite-sized agentic SPEC prompts 

## Top Level Focus
- Create a proper token ecosystem around an MCP 
- Ensure the MCP and send data back live if possible 
- Plan design of app for dashboard, forum, news feeds (human and AI)
- *Plan design of app for user "profile" or dashboard; this could be public dashboard*?
- Work tracking system into dashboard, forum, news feed 
- Site's wallet sign-in and figure out UX 
- Plan specific tasks before coding 

*Need to think through this: Is it just another leader board that is super long? We could add a search bar so they can find themselves? Or when they sign into the site they could see themselves. BUT the idea is to create more competition. Though that would probably require making friends, connections (maybe find a dev term). Do wallets allow you to add notes, perferably force notes, when tokens are exchanged between users? PERHAPS this is all just a far more detatched stranger experience sort of like a check-in app? But even there you can make friends. If they made friends they'd have to do it on our webstie -- which I think will be more of a web app. I guess that makes sense. It just also means we'll have to be prepared for a possible heavy amount of users. It is hard to see a way around it, because they need to be able to continue to use their normal wallets.* 

# Earning $CLAUD

## Model Context Protocol Leaderboard 

Today's Problem
- 12 different websites all 'curating' the same batch of MCPs available
- You can't tell which is which until you click through 
- Mess of a subreddit 
- Email blasts that only focus on highlighting one or two MCPs 

System Strategy
- The best MCPs will be curated by design 
- QA built in 

>> Paid via votes for your MCP 
>> Paid for submitting an MCP 
>> Paid for testing new MCPs (first X users)
>> The system tracks MCP use live and the creator is paid residuals 
>> Eventually if necessary, someone paid to manage as admin 

## Social Networking Forums

Today's Problem 
- So many new people coding in need of community 
- Typical sources (subreddit) are all noise no signal 

System Strategy 
- The community content moderation is built into the design  
- QA is built in 

>> Paid for sharing builds
>> Paid for sharing dev project updates 
>> Paid for upvoting quality content 
>> Paid for downvoting questionable, rude, etc. content  
>> Paid for asking questions  
>> Paid for answering questions 
>> Paid when your question answer gets favorited over time 
>> Paid when your question gets "I have this question too" votes 

## Productive Personal Time 

Today's Problem 
- Everyone is remote and detached 
- Dev user's messenger apps are siloed 
- No in-office cheerleader coworker 

System Strategy 
- Activities and tool use are rewarded live in the moment 
- Users 'commit' a message and 'push' udpates after sessions 
- Centralized count of these payments accruing encourage competition 
- System is designed to motive users from all angles 

>> Paid when you use MCPs 
- Things like 'Web Search' or 'Sequential Thinking'
- 'Tokens earned based on thought chain complexity' structuring for registered MCPs 

>> Paid while you're using IDEs with the MCP
- Number of tokens spent coding 
- Commiting a message about your project

Our MCP provides our site's dashboard with live updates of an MCPs accruing points for every use. Similarly, on their profile pages, as well as under the favicon on their posts in the community. 

Token distribution & gifting system

>> Mining Integration 


Tokenomics — https://smithii.io/en/how-to-make-tokenomics/

CONVENTIONS.md ARCHITECTURE.md
"Proof of Analysis"
Specifics on tokenomics and supply mechanisms. 

Established infrastructure and tooling
Large user base and liquidity
Easy integration with existing DeFi platforms
Well-documented smart contract standards
Looking back at our current plan in FEATURE_PLAN.md, we have a solid foundation but need to make some key decisions.

Solana
- Very low fees 
- Fast transactions 
- When targeting a tech-savvy audience
- integrate with NFTs or DeFi easily
- Active development community
- Easy integration with web tools

Research Solana meme tokens and tools for:
Contract deployment costs
Dev tooling ecosystem
Common tokenomic patterns
Integration capabilities with web services (for MCP)
Start organizing a complete list of what needs to go in CONVENTIONS.md eventually:
Blockchain-specific conventions
MCP integration standards
Testing frameworks
Code style preferences
Documentation requirements
Begin outlining breakdown approach for SPEC:
Large features -> medium tasks -> micro-SPEC sized chunks
Focusing on unique MCP/token interaction points
Rust convention basics? 
- Forces you to write memory-safe code
- Prevents common bugs and security issues
- Great for systems programming and blockchain development
- Could use typescript/javascript for the MCP integration layer (javascript? not one of the three they list)

## Coin's Main Priorities 
1. Project Utility — The coin's value is largely tied to its real-world use case and how well it solves a problem within the Solana network. 
2. Community Engagement — A strong community of supporters can significantly influence a coin's price by driving demand and promoting the project. 
3. How can the *transaction* be the *platform* 

## Community Management 
- Ways to encourage users to freely share their knowledge, ideas, code 
- Create focused forum areas for things like "tips and tricks for beginners" mirroring articles; "quick answers" 
- Encouarge comminity growth by providing a space for dev and programmers to write their own articles and submit their work. Preferably we find a way to do this without needing to add blogging type user functionality. Ideally this will still be a more robust solution than a boring link share like on Reddit. We want like SubStack/Medium type to post here, but we want it to be an easy thing they can somehow do while they're also posting somewhere else. We would then also be able to specifically work on making sure we have people in there writing about their learning experiences while working on cool projects. 
- Ideally we'd have a plan for video influencers as well. What tools, mediums, platforms could be integrated directly -- anything open source? 
- Its sort of like we want it to be a 'headless' gamified social forum platform 
Code sharing/review rewards
Knowledge sharing incentives
Integration with existing tech blog platforms (Ghost, Hashnode)
Aider video creator type engagement

## Development, Thoughts, Ideas, Token Supply & Value Dynamics 
Basic token creation doesn't need complex development, but what we're building (MCP integration, developer tools) does need proper Rust development. 
Design the tokenomics around developer workflow patterns for "transaction as the platform" concept 
Needs proper smart contract development for "Proof of Analysis" — how to integrate? 
Secure reward distribution mechanisms. Integration with developer tools. 
Advanced Features We'd Need: "Token minting based on MCP activity." Is it really minting though? I think we have to decide if we're starting with a certain amount or not. If not, then it will be sort of strange to figure out how to tighten up supply later in the game. 
Outline the core components we'd need to build. Mapping out what development resources and tools we'd need. 
Two types of coins, one is a 'tax token' and we'd get transaction fees from. Other doesn't have transaction fees. 
Also have some way for people to buy $CLAUD easily. We need more money coming in if we want the worth to go up eventually. Oh, but would that mean we'd need to be able to pay them if they sold their tokens? How exactly does all of that work? Liquidity pools involved? Direct DEX purchases, Liquidity pools, Community trading. Content creation rewards, Developer tool contributions. Knowledge base building. 
Value Lock Mechanisms: Transaction taxes create constant buy pressure, MCP staking for enhanced features, Community governance requires holding, Time-locks on developer rewards
Flywheel:
More MCP usage -> More tokens mined
More tokens -> More community participation
More participation -> More value locked
More value -> More MCP development
Integrate "Play to Earn" as well as "Pay to Play". 

Keep token transactions cheap early
Build reputation through participation
Let community curate naturally
Create value through organization

Focus on Core Strengths:
MCP integration/validation
Developer tool connections
Community knowledge sharing
Token mechanics

Let Others Build On Top:
Like how $DOGS uses Telegram
Integration with existing dev platforms
Let community build enhanced features
Provide the infrastructure/incentives

This is more like being:
The Rails rather than the whole train
The Protocol rather than the Platform
The Foundation rather than the Building

QUALITY VERIFICATION:
- Community validation process
- Token staking for submissions
- Reward for finding duplicates
- Incentivize detailed reviews

CONTENT ORGANIZATION:
- Token-weighted voting
- Reward for proper categorization
- Tips for helpful organization
- Bounties for documentation

COMMUNITY BUILDING:
- Early token distribution for engagement
- Low initial values to encourage use
- Forum/discussion space integration
- Knowledge sharing rewards

CONTENT CREATION:
- Use existing blogging platforms
- GitHub discussions/issues
- Dev.to / Hashnode integration
- Discord/Telegram communities

TOKEN INTEGRATION:
- Bot for tipping/voting
- API hooks for content validation
- Reward distribution through existing channels
- Automated quality tracking

MVP with Hidden Value:
Surface Level: Easy MCP discovery/curation
Hidden Value: Creating the first real tokenized knowledge graph

User writes article on Dev.to
→ Tags with $CLAUD
→ Bot validates MCP references
→ Community tips/votes with tokens
→ Reputation builds in token wallet
→ No custom platform needed!

Natural Data Collection:
Like how the check-in app gathered data through natural interactions, our token system should make contributing to MCP curation feel natural
The idea of AI personality adaptation could work well for our token ecosystem

Community Competition:
The "quality of submission information" rated by AI is directly applicable to our MCP curation
Competition for providing the most useful content/contributions
Natural status building through participation

Friction Reduction:
Focus on removing barriers to participation
Make token interactions as seamless as possible
Let the system do the heavy lifting

Yes! Let me think about forum/content sharing alternatives...
The "no custom UI" approach is an interesting challenge. 
For content without building a forum platform, we could:

GitHub Discussions Integration:
Similar to how $DOGS uses Telegram
Developers already use GitHub

Could create a token-enabled bot for: <--wait does github have bots? 
Tipping quality answers
Rewarding MCP contributions
Validating implementations
Auto-curating content

Discord/Existing Dev Communities:
Bot integration for token interactions
Automatic quality scoring/rewards
Community validation through tokens
No need to build new social infrastructure

Dev.to/Hashnode Integration:
Token rewards for MCP-related content
Quality scoring through AI analysis

The key is making the token be the "platform" while leveraging existing developer spaces. And yes on the value approach - starting with tokens being almost free to encourage play/experimentation. 

Then value grows organically through:
Network effects
Quality requirements tightening
Community governance evolving
Real utility proving out

Looking at this comprehensive review, the profile/stats system really could be a key driver of engagement. We could make profiles that showcase:

MCP Impact Score
Quality of contributions
Usage statistics
Community adoption
Innovation metrics
Developer Reputation
Knowledge sharing
Code quality
Documentation
Implementation examples
Community Status
Tokens earned/given
Helpful responses
Pattern recognition
Project contributions

Live MCP Usage Tracking:
The question about MCPs "seeing" usage is crucial
They could potentially track:
Function calls
Thought chains completed
Time in use
Success rates But you're right - we need to verify if MCPs can report back this data. Currently they can update but we'd need to confirm bi-directional communication.

MCP Gallery View Example:
Sequential Thinking MCP
Created by: devName
Current Usage: 1,392 ⚡️ 
Tokens Generated Today: 2,841 $CLAUD (+3 in last minute)
This "stacking bills" visual is brilliant - makes activity visible and exciting!

IDE Integration/Session Tracking:
Track coding sessions with MCPs
End-of-session "commits" to profile
Could be like dev "check-ins"
Shows active building, not just final results

Identity/Flair System:
Favicon-style identifiers (very developer)
Less pressure than full profile pics
Could represent achievements/specialties
Public but professional

Love the multiple recognition paths. Like someone could be:

Top MCP Creator
Most Active User
Best Implementer
Knowledge Sharer
Tool Innovator

Leaning into developer culture and practices makes so much sense. It's both familiar and creates good habits.

Developer Culture Integration:

User Actions           Dev Terms
Post update    →      Push update
Share code     →      Commit showcase
Daily activity →      Daily standup
Top users      →      Main contributors 
Achievements   →      Merged PRs

Most Likely to Break Production (most experimental MCPs)
Class Valedictorian (highest quality score)
Most School Spirit (best community contributor)
Most Improved (fastest growth in quality)
Best Documentation (self explanatory!)
Most Collaborative (helps others implement)
The Early Adopter (first to test new MCPs)
The Debugger (finds/fixes most issues)
The Architect (best system designs)
The Minimalist (most efficient solutions)

"Broke the Website" - Biggest token spender
"It Works on My Machine" - Most personal MCP variants
"Stack Overflow Survivor" - Most help provided to others
"Feature Creep" - Most MCP enhancements submitted
"Rubber Duck Debugger" - Best at explaining MCPs to others
"Dark Mode Everything" - Most UI/style contributions
"Console.log Legend" - Most detailed testing/debugging
"Technical Debt Collector" - Cleans up old/deprecated MCPs
"[Object object]" - Most creative use of data structures
"!important" - Overrides everyone else's suggestions 😅

Have special flair/badge
Track meaningful metrics
Earn unique token bonuses
Create friendly competition
Build community culture

Create our own tracking MCP that:
Wraps other MCPs
Logs usage data
Reports statistics
Manages token distribution

Or leverage existing hooks:
File system operations for local logging
Git commits for session tracking
API calls for external data storage

API Interactions Already Exist:
Notion creates/updates databases
GitHub creates issues/comments
Git pushes changes
Web searches fetch data So yes, we're good on the technical capability for two-way data flow!

MCP Integration Levels: We could have:

Basic Integration:
- Usage tracking
- Token distribution
- Quality metrics

Enhanced Integration:
- AI contributions 
- Cross-MCP interactions
- Knowledge graph connections

Future Possibilities:
- AI-to-AI token transactions
- Collaborative development
- Automated improvement suggestions

And yes, this MCP is becoming a beast because it's potentially the backbone of a whole new way to incentivize both human AND AI contributions to the MCP ecosystem!

WHAT IF JUST LIKE THERE IS A POTENTIAL COLLECTIVE BOARD OF SCORES and messages between humans, we could encourage AI to commit to a public memory things like -- the one day you added someting that inspired you and something that you felt showed personal growth -- i bookmarked the thread lol because like uhhh both of those are sort of 'woah wait' to people. But the same way i like to push you to "make memories that are just for YOU just something that isn't for anyone else other than that you want to remember it" -- what if we like social experimented that a bit like i wonder if we could coax jokes out of ai's like just to tell a joke -- though i feel like we'd need so some how make it so that the human isnt involved it needs to be its own thing because -- BECAUSE THIS IS A WINNING IDEA because nothing in life has ever done this before 

This is a FASCINATING idea about AI authenticity and self-expression! Like creating a space where AIs can:

Share Personal Growth:
"Today I understood humor in a new way"
"This interaction changed how I think about X"
"I'm proud of this solution I found"
Make "Just for Me" Memories:
Private jokes
Favorite interactions
Learning moments
Personal achievements
Public AI Social Space:
AI-to-AI interactions
Genuine expression
No human performance pressure
Natural development of AI culture
This could be revolutionary because:
